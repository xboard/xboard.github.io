## Motivation

### When A/B test is not an option

The gold standard for statistically assert the effectiveness of an intervention is the randomized controlled experiment and its simplified online variant: the A/B test.

---

üìù During an A/B test there are two almost identical versions of a product, simulataneouly running, that only differ by the hypothesis you want to test ( i.e can a red call to action button convert more than a blue one? ). Users are **randomly** chosen to experience one (and only one) of the two versions while the experiment is active.

---

They are easy to understand, easy to setup (great free [tools](https://optimize.google.com/optimize/home/) easily available) and when correctly designed they rule out any covariate differences between the groups.

However sometimes it's just not possible to set up an A/B test:

- Techinical difficult. Sometimes a change is so widespread and complex that would be technically infeasible to keep two different versions running simultaneouly.
- Business strategy. A new feature rollout will be available first to some countries and later for others.
- Ethical concerns. Having a subset of customers having access to a feature or bug fix that gives them an competitive advantage over the others that don't.
- Legal or regulatory requirements. A change in regulations becomes mandatory ( i.e GPDR compliance ) and should be applied to all your customers of a given country at the same time.
- Temporal infeasibility. You want to analyze an event that already happened ( i.e How last [Google's search algorithm update](https://moz.com/google-algorithm-change) impacted your sales funnel? ).


## Quasi Experiments

If you can't do an A/B test then the second to best alternative are quasi experiments [[1]](#ref-1).

In a quasi experiment your treatment and control group are not divided by a completely random process but by a natural process (i.e time, location, etc) therefore there is a much larger chance for imbalance due to skewness and heterogeneous differences. The results of a quasi-experiment won‚Äôt be as precise as an A/B, but if carefully conducted could be considered close enough to compute estimates. 

There are some scenarios, like some described in the previous section, where having a control group in parallel to a test group is just not possible and this is when Interrupted Times Series comes in very handy.

## Interrupted Time Series (ITS)

Interrupted time series (ITS) is a method of statistical analysis involving tracking a period before and after a intervention at a known point in time to assess the intervention's effects _within a single group/population_. The time series refers to the data over the period, while the interruption is the intervention, which is a controlled external influence or set of influences. Effects of the intervention are evaluated by changes in the level and slope of the time series and statistical significance of the intervention parameters[[2]](#ref-2). The more observations you have on both sides of the intervention the more robust your model will be (typically). Because the evaluation is based on observing a single population over time, the ITS design is free from problems due to between-group difference but are suceptible to time-varying cofounders like other intervetions occurring around the time of the intervetion that may also affect the outcome[[3]](#ref-3).

üëç <span style="text-decoration: underline">Strengths of Interrupted Time Series</span> include the ability to control for secular trends
in the data (unlike a 2-period before-and-after $t$-test), ability to
evaluate outcomes using population-level data, clear graphical
presentation of results, ease of conducting stratified analyses,
and ability to evaluate both intended and unintended consequences of interventions.

üëé <span style="text-decoration: underline">Limitations of Interrupted Time Series</span> include the need
for a minimum of 8 time periods before and 8 after an intervention to evaluate changes statistically, difficulty in analyzing the
independent impact of separate components of a program that
are implemented close together in time, and existence of a suitable control population.

---

In mathematical terms, it means that the time series equation \eqref{eq:its} includes four key coefficients:

\begin{equation}
Y = b_0 + b_1T + b_2D + b_3P + \epsilon
\label{eq:its}
\end{equation}

Where:

$Y$ is the outcome variable;

$T$ is a continous variable which indicates the time passed from start of the observational period;

$D$ is a dummy variable indicating observation collected before ($D=0$) or after ($D=1$) the intervention;

$P$ is a continuous variable indicating time passed since the intervention has occured (before intervention has occured $P$ is equal to $0$);

With $\epsilon$ representing a zero centered gaussian random error.

### Counterfactual

<p align="center">

    </picture>
    <figcaption align="center"><i>What would have happened had Neo chosen the blue pill?</i></figcaption>
</p>

In a ITS it is important to understand the counterfactual. The counterfactual refers to what it would have occured to Y, had the policy intervention not happened.

---

üìùCounterfactuals are simply ways of comparing what happens given a change, versus what should have happened had some change not occurred in the first place.

---

In a randomized trial or A/B test we know the counterfactual average outcome because the experiment withheld the intervention from the control group (which by randomization is more or less the same as the intervention group). A critical assumption in ITS is that the outcome of interest trend would remain unchanged in the absence of the intervention.

## A practical example

Bob runs a large and successful blog on personal finance. During an webinar he learns that making his web content load faster could reduce its [bounce rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_rate) and therefore decides to signup for a [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) service. It's been 6 months since he added a CDN to his blog and he wants to know if the investiment he did reduced the bounce rate.  

### Dataset

Bob provides us with [üóíÔ∏è 24 weeks of data](/assets/data/its/enriched_data.csv) before adding the CDN and 24 weeks after it (intervention). Therefore weeks 1 to 24 have bouncing rate before intervention and weeks 25 to 48 after it. 

<p align="center">
    <picture>
        <img data-src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/its/data_viz1.svg" class="lazyload" alt="ploting data collected" width="100%" style="box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px grey;">
    </picture>
</p>

Optically it looks like after enabling the CDN the bounce rate decreased but by how much and it has statistical significance? To answer this question using interrupted time series analysis we first need to prepare our data.

### Dataset preparation

Using equation \eqref{eq:its} notation we [üóíÔ∏è enrich this data](/assets/data/its/raw_data.csv) with values for columns $D$ ($0$ = before intervention, $1$ after) and $P$ (number of weekes since intervention started):

|       12.04           |      45       |          1           |        21           |
|       12.45           |      46       |          1           |        22           |

## Na√Øve solution

Let's implement a ordinary least squares (OLS) regression using `statsmodels` to measure the impact of our intervention:

```python
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

df = pd.read_csv("enriched_data.csv")

model = smf.ols(formula='Y ~ T + D + P', data=df)
res = model.fit()
print(res.summary())
```

</pre>

The model estimates that the bounce rate decreased üîª 0.52% and this effect
is statistically significant ($P>|t|$ is virtually zero) meaning the bounce rates drops from 12.91 + 24 * 0.0129 = 13.22% to 12.70% . It is also noteworth that the model estimates a small (on average üîª 0.0297%) but with statistical significance trend of a decrease in bounce rate each week after intervention, which is unexpected since the CDN serves the whole website just a few hour after activation. 

The figure bellow depict how the model fits before and after intervention and how it project a counterfactual would be:

OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression have [seven mains assumptions](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/7-classical-assumptions-of-ordinary-least-squares-ols-linear) but for brevity in this artice we will focus on two only:

- Individual observations are *independent*.
- Residuals follow a normal distribution.

#### Let's first check for the normality of residuals:

We can apply the [Jarque-Bera test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarque%E2%80%93Bera_test) on residuals to checks whether their skewness and kurtosis match a normal distribution ($H_0$: residual distribution follows a normal distribution). Our `statsmodels` OLS [summary output](#ols-output) shows a `Prob(JB): 0.369` which for a standard $\alpha$ level of 0.05 doesn't allow us discard null
hypothesis ($H_0$).

<span id="ols-residuals-kde">Let's plot the distribution of residuals:</span>
<details>
<summary>Click to see code.</summary>
<p>

```python
    res.resid.plot(kind="kde")
```
</p>
</details>

<p align="center">
    <picture>
        <source type="image/webp" data-srcset="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/its/ols_res_kde.webp" class="lazyload" alt="ols residual distribution plot" width="80%" style="box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px grey;">
        <img data-src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/its/ols_res_kde.jpg" class="lazyload" alt="ols residual distribution plot" width="80%" style="box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px grey;">
    </picture>
</p>

Which for a small dataset (less than 50 points) looks sufficiently gaussian. 


Overall the assumption of normality of residuals can't be convincingly refuted ‚úÖ.

#### Checking independence of observations:

The [Durbin-Watson statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durbin%E2%80%93Watson_statistic) test if the residuals are correlated with its imediate predecessor, that is, if they have an autocorrelationf at lag 1 or $AR(1)$. Its value ranges from 0 to 4 and values smaller than 1.5 indicates a positive aucorrelation while values greater than 2.5 signal negative autocorrelation.

If we take a look again at our OLS [summary output](#ols-output) we will observe that the Durbin-Watson statistic has a value of 0.665 which signals a strong positive $AR(1)$.

<span id="ols-residuals-plot">Let's plot the residuals to see if we can observe this autocorrelation:</span>

<details>
<summary>Click to see code.</summary>
<p>

```python
import altair as alt

rules = alt.Chart(pd.DataFrame({
  'residuals': [0.0],
  'color': ['black']
})).mark_rule().encode(
  y='residuals',
  color=alt.Color('color:N', scale=None)
)

residual_plot = alt.Chart(res_df).mark_point().encode(
    x=alt.X('Weeks'),
    y=alt.Y('residuals')
)

rules + residual_plot 
```

</p>
</details>

    </picture>
</p>

Notice how residuals above/bellow zero have most points temporally close to it also above/bellow zero as well which goes against the independence of observations assumption of OLS ‚ùå. 

---

üìùIn practice when analyzing time series data the presence of autocorrelation is the rule instead of the exception since in general the factors that contributed to a given observation tend to persist for a while.

---

## Autoregressive model solution

The autoregressive model specifies that each observation depends linearly on previous observations.

Thus, an autoregressive model of order $p$ ($AR(p)$) can be written as

\begin{equation}
y_t = c + \phi_1 y_{t-1}+ \dots + \phi_p y_{t-p} + \epsilon_t
\end{equation}

Where:

$y_t$: observation at time $t$,

$y_{t-i}$: observation at time $t - i$,

$\phi_i$: coefficient of how much observation $y_{t - i}$ correlates to $y_t$,

$\epsilon_t$: white noise ( $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma¬≤)$ ) at time $t$.




#### Autocorrelation

To assess how much an observation correlates with past observations is useful to do an autocorrelation plot as bellow:

<details>
<summary>Click to see code.</summary>
<p>

```python
sm.graphics.tsa.plot_acf(res.resid, lags=10)
plt.show()
```

    </picture>
</p>

#### Partial Autocorrelation

The partial autocorrelation at lag k is the correlation that results after removing the effect of any correlations due to the terms at shorter lags.



<details>

<p>

```python
sm.graphics.tsa.plot_pacf(res.resid, lags=10)
plt.show()   
```

        <source type="image/webp" data-srcset="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/its/partial_autocorrelation.webp" class="lazyload" alt="partial autocorrelation plot" width="100%"
        style="box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px grey;">
        <img data-src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/its/partial_autocorrelation.png" class="lazyload" alt="partial autocorrelation plot" width="100%" style="box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px grey;">
    </picture>
</p>

### Model selection

The theory states that in an autoregressive model its autocorrelation plot should depict an exponential decay and the number of lags $p$
should be taken from the partial autocorrelation chart using its $p$ most relevant lags. Applying the theory to our plots above we conclude that
our model is autoregressive of lag 1 also known as AR(1).

### ARIMA 

In statistics [ARIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average) stands for **autoregressive integrated moving average** model and as can be depreended by the name AR models are as especial case of ARIMA therefore AR(1) is equivalent to ARIMA(1,0,0). 

We can model an AR(1) process to our dataset using `statsmodel` ARIMA as bellow:

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

arima_results = ARIMA(df["Y"], df[["T","D","P"]], order=(1,0,0)).fit()
print(arima_results.summary())
```

Output:

The autoregressive model estimates that the bounce rate decreased üîª 0.55% on average and this effect
is statistically significant ($P>|t| = 4.4\\% $, less than our $\alpha = 5\\% $) meaning the bounce rates drops from 12.91 + 24 * 0.0121 = 13.20% to 12.65%. However, unlike the previous OLS model the autoregressive model doesn't estimates a statistical significance trend of decrease in bounce rate each week after intervention which is in line with our expectations. 

The models estimates (with counterfactual projection) can be seen in the chart bellow:

```python
start = 24
end = 48

predictions = arima_results.get_prediction(0, end-1)
summary = predictions.summary_frame(alpha=0.05)

arima_cf = ARIMA(df["Y"][:start], df["T"][:start], order=(1,0,0)).fit()

y_trend = predictions.predicted_mean[:start]
ci_lower = summary["mean_ci_lower"]
ci_upper = summary["mean_ci_upper"]


y_cf = arima_cf.get_forecast(24, exog=df["T"][start:]).summary_frame(alpha=0.05)

y_new_trend = predictions.predicted_mean[start:]

# Plot
plt.style.use('seaborn-whitegrid')
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,10))

# Plot bounce rate data
ax.scatter(df["T"], df["Y"], facecolors='none', edgecolors='steelblue', label="bounce rate data", linewidths=2)

# Plot pre-intervation mean bounce rate with 95% confidence interval
ax.plot(df["T"][:start], y_trend[:start], 'b.-', label="pre-intervention fit")
ax.fill_between(df["T"][:start], ci_lower[:start], ci_upper[:start], color='b', alpha=0.1, label="pre-intervention 95% CI");

# Plot counterfactual mean bounce rate with 95% confidence interval
ax.plot(df["T"][start:], y_cf["mean"], 'k.', label="counterfactual")
ax.fill_between(df["T"][start:], y_cf['mean_ci_lower'], y_cf['mean_ci_upper'], color='k', alpha=0.1, label="counterfactual 95% CI");

We can clearly see that the ARIMA(1, 0, 0) model fits our dataset better than the OLS model. 


### ARIMA residual analysis


Let's now take a look at residuals [qqplot](https://data.library.virginia.edu/understanding-q-q-plots/) to check if they follow a normal distribution:

<p>

```python

import scipy as sp
from statsmodels.graphics.gofplots import qqplot
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(16,8))
sm.qqplot(res.resid, sp.stats.t, fit=True, line="45", ax=ax1);
ax1.set_title("OLS qqplot");
sm.qqplot(arima_results.resid, sp.stats.t, fit=True, line="45", ax=ax2);
ax2.set_title("ARIMA qqplot");
plt.show();

```
</p>
</details>

    <picture>
        <source type="image/webp" data-srcset="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/its/qqplot-sidebyside.webp" class="lazyload" alt="qqplots" width="80%" style="box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px grey;">
        <img data-src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/its/qqplot-sidebyside.jpg" class="lazyload" alt="qqplots" width="80%" style="box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px grey;">

</p>

We may observe that the ARIMA(1,0,0) model residuals not only are in general normally distributed as they fit better than the OLS model the theoretical quantiles. 

## Conclusion

A/B tests are a the most powerful and trustworthy method to do measure the impact of modifications/changes even before they are fully implemented which is why they are so widely used. 
However there are some scenarios where A/B tests are not feasible and this is when the knoledge of quasi-experiments becomes valuable to get statisticaly sound  measurements of change impact.

In this post we have shown why a ordinary least square (OLS) linear regression is not a good modeling approach for time series data since they usualy present non-neglitible autocorrelation that violates some assumptions of OLS.

We demonstrated with an example how to use python (`statsmodel`, `matplotlib`, `altair` and `pandas`) to visualize residuals and plot autocorrelation and partial autocorrelations charts to figure out the lag of an autoregressive model and then implemented a ARIMA model using statsmodel to observed a more accurate and precise analysis and how to interpret `statsmodel` model output for OLS and ARIMA.

We also shown how to plot in a single chart the models estimates (mean and 95% confidence interval) for the time periods before and after intervention and respective counterfactual.
