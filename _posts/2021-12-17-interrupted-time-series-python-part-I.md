### When A/B test is not an option

The gold standard for statistically assert the effectiveness of an intervention is the randomized controlled experiment and its simplified online variant: the **A/B testing**.

They are easy to understand, easy to setup (great free tools and libraries easily available) and when correctly designed they rule out any covariate differences between the groups.

However sometimes it's just not possible to set up an A/B test:

- Techinical difficult. Sometimes a chage is so widespread and complex that would be technically infeasible to keep two different versions running simultaneouly.
- Business strategy. A new feature rollout will be available first to some countries and later for others.
- Ethical concerns. Having a subset of your customers to a feature or bug fixe that gives them an competitive advantage over the others 
- Legal or regulatory requirements. A change in regulations becomes mandatory (i.e GPDR compliance) and should be applied to all your customers of a given country at the same time.
- Temporal infeasibility. You want to analyze an event that already happened (i.e How last [Google's search algorithm update](https://moz.com/google-algorithm-change) impacted your sales funnel?).


## Quasi Experiments

If you can't do an A/B test then the second to best alternative are Quasi Experiments.

In a quasi experiment your treatment and control group are not divided by a  completely random process but by a are considered close enough to compute estimates.

One morning during his matinal run Bob come up with an idea on how to improve a metric for your product or business. You are quite confident on its benefit and decide to rollout it to all your customers
